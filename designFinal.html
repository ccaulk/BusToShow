            <br>Bus to Show was delivered to the present through
            telepathic communication (ITC) from the future
            <br>(13 years from now (the 5th year of the convergence))
            as part of a strategy to implement systems in the past (present)
            designed to save the future (of existence) by reducing
            impaired driving (preventing tragic disruptions
            <br>in the trajectory of life energies embodied by future pivotal leaders)
            and fuel consumption that results
            <br>from events
            (acceleration of the consequences of climate change).
            <br>All you have to do be part of the solution, is ride the bus, and we'll take care of the rest.
            <br>
